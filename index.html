</picture><p>Consider the power of your words.</p><p>It’s a touchy subject. We word peeps seem to walk a fine line between being considered conscientious and superstitious. Most people, even secular people will agree to a point that words have power and that what you say can or will affect what you see
    for the good for the bad.</p><p>But what seems to be the case is that people will agree with the principle insofar as it only counts the words you say that you REALLY mean. And that if you use them as some form of colorful language or figure of speech, then that doesn't really count,
    because after all, “you know what I mean!”</p><p>It starts to feel a little limiting and maybe even a bit overboard when you start stopping yourself from saying phrases of common vernacular. But I'd still hold to when it comes down to having what you say, you better be saying what you want to have.
    And largely… we don’t. We say what is on our minds. We deliver the bad news of the situation as fact. We adopt even the most ridiculous language of the world. As a result, many of us, nay I dare say most of us don't yet have enough power and authority
    in our words to be able to immediately see the manifestation of those things we declare by the Spirit.</p><p>I've often mused that a big reason for that is because we are so careless with our words when we are not “being spiritual” that God can't really back us when we are. It’s like the king who wanted everything he touched to turn to gold. It’s a colorful
    expression and we know what he meant, and what he wanted. But he certainly didn't understand the repercussions of such a wish. We are the same way; we are wishing that our words had power, but if they did, where would we be?</p><p>In reality, we want our words to count only when we want them to. We want them to be powerful when we speak to the mountain and more relaxed when we speak to our friends. We want to be able to communicate on a common plane with the rest of humanity, but
    still be able to command the wind and the waves. The trouble is spiritual things are absolute. And I believe true, pure faith in the word of God would have to recognize that you can’t speak like the world and get heaven’s results.</p><p>If we want power in our words when we say “get behind me, satan,” it will also be there when we tell a friend “get out of town!” You would never hear Jesus say that he was clumsy, or forgetful, or God forbid lame… not in false humility, nor in jest. You
    would have been labeled a blasphemer to say, “God is incredible!”—He is entirely credible! He is faithful and true, even if every man were a liar. The revival meeting was not fantastic—superhero movies are fantastic: fantastical, made up of things
    of fantasy, as opposed to reality.</p><p>Is that what we want people to believe about our God? Is that the word seed you want to sow into the life of a fellow believer or someone who doesn't know Him yet? The Sower sows the Word, but all sowers sow words. You may not immediately see your harvest,
    but they could sprout overnight, or they could lie dormant for a while. In either case, be not deceived, God will not be mocked, whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap. Make sure you are scattering only good seed!</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-dbcecfa1-367f-480c-b5b2-3c9e58bb5a6f" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="28"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="30"><a class=" " href="this-is-me-just-a-girl-with-a-guitar-who-is-at-her-happies" data-reactid="31"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="32"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="33"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1f3bda4566984407d9c0af1fd9d994ab/insta_hefe.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee0d10f-d8b0-4ab9-8f29-83350d00c66f.png&amp;width=662" style="object-position:56.11782477341389% 42.29957805907173%;" data-reactid="34"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1f3bda4566984407d9c0af1fd9d994ab/insta_hefe.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee0d10f-d8b0-4ab9-8f29-83350d00c66f.png&amp;width=662" style="object-position:56.11782477341389% 42.29957805907173%;" data-reactid="35"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1f3bda4566984407d9c0af1fd9d994ab/insta_hefe.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee0d10f-d8b0-4ab9-8f29-83350d00c66f.png&amp;width=662" style="object-position:56.11782477341389% 42.29957805907173%;" data-reactid="36"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ced91ff16a7456cc4cdc977187acf6c5/insta_hefe.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee0d10f-d8b0-4ab9-8f29-83350d00c66f.png&amp;width=360" style="object-position:56.11782477341389% 42.29957805907173%;" data-reactid="37"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="662" data-height="474" data-ratio="1.3966244725738397" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1f3bda4566984407d9c0af1fd9d994ab/insta_hefe.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffee0d10f-d8b0-4ab9-8f29-83350d00c66f.png&amp;width=662" style="object-position:56.11782477341389% 42.29957805907173%;" data-reactid="38"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="39"><!-- react-empty: 40 --><!-- react-empty: 41 --><!-- react-empty: 42 --><!-- react-empty: 43 --><!-- react-empty: 44 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="45"><p>This is me.
